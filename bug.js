This error occurs when using the `useRef` hook in React Native with a component that is unmounted before the ref's callback is executed.  This typically happens when navigating away from a screen quickly or when the component is removed from the tree before the asynchronous operation using the ref completes.  Here's an example:

```javascript
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const myRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
      if (myRef.current) {
        // Perform some action using the ref
        console.log('Ref is still mounted:', myRef.current);
      }
    }, 1000);

    return () => clearInterval(intervalId);
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text ref={myRef}>Hello</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

If `MyComponent` is unmounted before the `setInterval` callback has a chance to run,  `myRef.current` could be null, leading to an error or unexpected behavior.  This is common in scenarios involving network requests or animations that outlive the component's lifecycle.
